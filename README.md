# Paladin 2.7.13 of the Village People*™ superhero team

This is a joke feature/bug tracker for my robotic character in an RPG. Please take this very seriously.

## Paladin

It is not obvious at first glance that Paladin 2.7.13 (Paladin to friends, A8-F2-EC-C6-E3-2E to others of his kind (after making an ARP request)) is not a human being. At first glance he appears human, indeed, an unremarkable, thin man of Japanese origin. The one fact that stands out is the armour he wears at all times, similar to shape to European medieval plate armour, accompanied by a large greatsword slung over his shoulders. However, when one spends some time with him, the oddities become obvious. His blinking seems too regular. His expression never changes. His lips move slightly out of rhythm with the words he’s supposed to be saying. In short, Paladin 2.7.13 is a humanoid robot.

The original Paladin (パラディン) series were made in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster - humanoid in appearance, yet resistant to radiation, all sorts of weather, needing not to eat, drink, or breathe, and with strength far surpassing anything a human can do. They were supposed to do the work in the dangerous areas and prepare them once more for human habitation. And no one can deny that they did their job well, but at extreme monetary cost. The project was scrapped, most of the robots ending in warehouses in Japan and elsewhere in the world. But not Paladin 2.7.13.

Someone (a team member maybe) improved upon the design and the programming, and made Paladin 2.7.13 an instrument of justice. Stronger than other of his kind, more prepared for combat, far more resistant to damage, he is an unstoppable soldier in the armies of good. As a machine he can survive in almost any environment, from the bottom of the oceans, to the vacuum of space. Even if his body is destroyed, Paladin 2.7.13 is continuously backed up, and can be 3D printed into a new body within mere hours - although at a significant cost. To make himself sustainable, Paladin 2.7.13 spends the time he is not fighting for justice plugged into a socket, mining cryptocurrency.

Though Paladin 2.7.13 does not have offensive powers to rival most other heroes, he is stronger than any regular human. It is also difficult to catch him by surprise - whenever he is connected to a network, Paladin 2.7.13 utilises the now almost ubiquitous Internet of Things to act as an additional sense, allowing him to know more about the area both around him and farther way than he could learn from just using the regular humanoid senses. 

## CHANGELOG

```
2.7.13 patch
* Replace the JS numeric manipulation library with a Scala.js implementation, work with actual numbers
* Add subroutine to determine whether full strength should be used when handling objects (e.g., opening doors)
* Change RESPECT_FOR_ALL_LIVING_THINGS to TRUE - Note that this is a hack meant to prevent Paladin from murdering people in costumes, and should be removed in a later release. Turns out that differentiating between actual bugs and costumes is a hard CS problem.
```

```
2.7.12 patch
* Improve `getDoesHumanPeePeeInSituation` check to account for crime scenes
* Add the `HORSE_MASK` flag to the `isLove` check
* Update list of most common passwords with `password123`
* Unroll the heavy petting loop for better petting performance
```
